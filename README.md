# glueHTM

## Vision and Concept

### Aim
#### Problems
	Unsurmountable amount of clutter is created on disk by "*_files/" (and its content) everytime a webpage is saved.
#### Solution
	Zip.STORE the entire "*_files/" and its corresponding ".htm(?l)" counterpart in a zip file with name same as the name_of_webpage with extension `htmz` --> later provide browser add-ons that can open htmz

### Dependencies
saneZip interface to zip library
