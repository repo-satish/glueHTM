# glueHTM

zip `webpage.htm*` and corresponding `webpage_files` directory in a single unit

#### Problem
Unsurmountable amount of clutter is created on disk by "*_files/" (and its content) everytime a webpage is saved.

#### Solution
Zip.STORE the entire "*_files/" and its corresponding ".htm(?l)" counterpart in a zip file with name same as the name_of_webpage with extension `htmz` --> later provide browser add-ons that can open htmz

### Dependencies
saneZip interface to zip library
